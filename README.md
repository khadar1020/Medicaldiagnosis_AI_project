# Medicaldiagnosis_AI_project
I think this is the best project for machine learning aspirants to start with this project covers many libraries used in machine in machine learning and GUI. 

This also creates a GUI so that it will be easy for the user to approach it is trained using large data sets and uses KNN and logistic regression algorithms to train the data 

This project is an implementation of a medical diagnosis system using Python. It was developed as part of the SPARK project held in RVCE and won the first prize. The system is designed to diagnose three diseases: Parkinson's disease, heart disease, and diabetes.

## Overview

The medical diagnosis system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and provide diagnostic predictions. It is intended to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases more accurately and efficiently.

## Features

- Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease based on patient's movement data.
- Diagnosis of heart disease based on patient's medical history and test results.
- Diagnosis of diabetes based on patient's demographic and clinical information.
